# Boulder Bot (CPE Senior Project)
**NOTE: This project is still in progress, expected finish date is early June 2024.** \
\
This repository contains a mobile app built with React Native and a backend built with Python using the Flask framework. \
\
The app allows climbers to create custom bouldering routes using pre-existing climbing holds and routes in a climbing gym.
Our backend leverages a YOLOv8 instance segmentation model trained on a custom dataset, which can detect and outline climbing holds in an image.

## Demo
